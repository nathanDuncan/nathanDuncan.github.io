# Web Portfolio
This portfolio project is intended to practice my web development skills, with the added bonus that the outcome can serve as a supplementry resource for job recruiters.

## Programming
My plan is to implement the static site using HTML and CSS. I will incorporate functionality with JavaScript or Django and will attemp to host the site through GitHub.

## Acknowledgements
The layout of this site was inspired by the video tutorial [Responsive Portfolio Website From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU&t=6s) by How to Become a Developer
