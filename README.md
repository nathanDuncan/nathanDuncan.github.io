This portfolio project is intended to practice my web development skills, with the added bonus that the outcome can serve as a supplementry resource for job recruiters.

## Programming
My plan is to implement the static site using HTML and CSS. I will incorporate functionality with Django and will attemp to host the site through GitHub.
