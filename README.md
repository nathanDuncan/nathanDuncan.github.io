# My Web Portfolio

A "full-stack" portfolio website showcasing my work as a Robotics Engineering student. This project serves as a comprehensive display of my experience, projects, and skills for recruiters and peers alike.

## 📖 About the Project

This portfolio was built with two primary goals:

- Skill Development: To practice and demonstrate modern web development skills.

- Professional Showcase: To serve as a supplementary resource for job recruiters, providing a deeper look into my engineering background than a standard resume allows.

The site features an animated dark theme with some cool UAV background animations. It includes sections for About, Experience, Projects, and Contact.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture (Version 2)

While the original concept was built with static HTML/CSS, the current version (v2) has been upgraded to a modern Single Page Application (SPA) architecture optimized for performance and maintainability.

### Frontend

**Framework:** React with TypeScript for robust type safety.

**Build Tool:** Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.

**Routing:** Client-side routing for seamless navigation.

**State Management:** React Query for efficient data handling.

### UI & Design System

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for easy theming.

**Components:** Built using shadcn/ui and Radix UI for accessible, consistent design patterns.

**Icons:** Lucide Icons.

**Theming:** Modern dark color palette with neon accents and "Share Tech Mono" typography for a technical aesthetic.

**Animations:** Custom JavaScript-based UAV movement animations and smooth scrolling behavior.

### Deployment

**Hosting:** GitHub Pages.

**CI/CD:** Automated deployment workflow using gh-pages.
